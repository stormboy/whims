	<h2>A Web Hyperspace Interface via MQTT over Socket.IO</h2>
	
	<p>	This project provides a web interface a MQTT service.  A browser or other <a href="http://socket.io/">Socket.IO</a> client
		communicates to a MQTT server over standard HTTP/1.1 protocols.
		The topic structure and payload are specified in the Meemplex specifications (to be announced).
		S-Expressions are used as payload format.
	</p>	
	<p>	The intention is that this can provide a gateway for "things" (e.g. devices, browsers, servers) 
		to communicate with other things over standard web protocols.  
		This services provides the ability to add a layer of 
		security to things communicating with the MQTT server.
	</p>
	<p>	The server is implemented in Node.js and may be run with
		<ul><code>&gt; node whims.js</code></ul>
	</p>
	
	<h3>MQTT PubSub</h3>
	<p>	The <a href="mqtt.html">MQTT PubSub test page</a> allows you to subcribe and publish to MQTT topics
		on the configured MQTT server.  The MQTT server details are specified in the settings.json file in 
		the project root.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Automation Interface</h3>
	<p>	A <a href="touch.html">touch-oriented web UI</a> for interacting with things.
		This presently has binary buttons.  
		The widgets included are determined by the file <a href="ui.json">ui.json</a>
